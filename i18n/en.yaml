- id: "showcase_description"
  translation: "This is a high performance theme for the Hugo static site generator. 
    This sample content can be edited in the locale files (as the theme supports translations).
    <br>
    You can download this theme from <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme'>github</a>, 
    and see it live <a target='_blank' href='https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/'>as a demo site</a> 
    or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.adrianmoreno.info'>a real one</a>.
    <br>
    The content you see so far in the homepage is:
    <ul>
      <li>Site logo/name: site config file (<code>hugo.toml</code>)</li>
      <li>Site top menu: site config file (<code>hugo.toml</code>), look for the <code>[[languages.en.menus.header]]</code> section</li>
      <li>This paragraph: <code>i18n/en.yaml</code> (for English)</li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, the order of the items in the homepage is configured in the <code>sections</code> array in the <code>hugo.toml</code> file:
    <code>sections = [
  \"showcase\",
  \"about\",
  \"education\",
  \"experience\",
  \"client-and-work\",
  \"testimonial\",
  \"contact\",
  \"newsletter\",
  ]</code><br/> 
  The content of each section is defined in the <code>data/homepage.yml</code> file (ie: links to social sites, mail, ...).
  <br/>
  If you scroll this page you will see some hints on where the content comes from - all the way to the footer menu. These links come from the site config file (<code>hugo.toml</code>), look for the <code>[[languages.en.menus.footer]]</code> section."
