I build physics-informed and data-driven models to understand how alloy chemistry shapes defect behavior in advanced materials. My research spans density functional theory, interpretable machine learning, and the development of reactive force fields for nuclear materials.

Below is a selection of projects where I combined high-fidelity simulations with modern data analysis tools to accelerate materials discovery.
