## Graduate Researcher, Hunan University

- Investigated oxygen interactions with alloying elements in $\alpha$-zirconium using first-principles calculations to predict diffusion barriers across alloy compositions.
- Generated 100+ defect configurations for Zr--Nb--H--O systems to train a reactive force field that supports molecular dynamics simulations of in-reactor corrosion.
- Built a dataset of 1,050 HCP structures with non-metal interstitials and applied SISSO and SHAP to derive interpretable models that explain alloying effects on defect energetics.
