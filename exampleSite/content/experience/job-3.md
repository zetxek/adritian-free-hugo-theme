### 3rd job: CIO

As Chief Information Officer at Internet Affairs Inc., I lead the strategic transformation of our digital infrastructure and cybersecurity initiatives. My team of 150+ IT professionals works tirelessly to protect and optimize our global network spanning 23 countries.

During my tenure, I've spearheaded the implementation of a revolutionary blockchain-based verification system that reduced fraudulent transactions by 87% while improving processing speeds by 300%. This initiative saved the company $12M annually and earned us the prestigious "Digital Innovation Award 2024".

I'm particularly proud of our "Green Computing" program which has successfully migrated 75% of our data centers to renewable energy sources. This environmental initiative not only reduced our carbon footprint by 45% but also resulted in a 30% reduction in operational costs.

In my role, I also serve as a member of the executive board, helping shape the company's long-term technology vision and ensuring our IT strategy aligns perfectly with our business objectives. Currently leading an ambitious AI integration project that promises to revolutionize our customer service capabilities.
