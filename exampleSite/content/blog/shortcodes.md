Shortcodes are a convenient [functionality of Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/), allowing you to embed templates or layouts within other content.

Some of the example built-in shortcodes are Instagram posts, YouTube videos, QR codes, etc. You can find [the full list in the official docs](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#embedded).

The theme provides also custom shortcodes:

- `education-list`
- `experience-list`

You can see them in effect in [the CV page](/cv) [`(see source)`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zetxek/adritian-demo/refs/heads/main/content/cv.md).
