# Adritian Free Hugo Theme
###### Adritian Hugo Theme for Personal Websites or Professional minimalistic landing pages

See it live at **[adritian-demo.vercel.app](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/)** (simple demo site, vanilla installation) or **[adrianmoreno.info](https://www.adrianmoreno.info)** (my personal site, running on this theme)

This free Hugo theme is a fork of [Raditian Theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme) - a great Hugo theme originally created by [Radity](https://github.com/radity). It's called __Adritian__ because I, the author, am called AdriÃ¡n - and if you shuffle Raditian and AdriÃ¡n letters you get... Adritian ðŸ˜…

It focuses on accessibility, high performance and usability. It's extendable by adding your own styles or content types, with a solid foundation.

The templates are based on Bootstrap (so they're responsive and mobile-first), and the main changes I have made have been upgrades on the web performance and accessibility of the template.

Some of the best applications for the theme are for minimalistic websites, single-page applications, and personal portfolios. It has a contact form you can customize to your mail address without setting up a backend (https://formspree.io).


ðŸš€ Some of the improvements (vs the original theme):

- removal of jQuery
- upgrade of Bootstrap from v4 to v5
- Hugo assets pipeline support
- some (basic) i18n features
- added more pages/templates (experience, blog)
- upgrade loading performance (100 score in [Google Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev))

## Live demo

You can see it live at [www.adrianmoreno.info](https://www.adrianmoreno.info) (my personal website), as well as in this screenshot for reference:

You have two reference implementations of the theme:
1. A full-featured site, [my personal website](https://www.adrianmoreno.info) [in github too](https://github.com/zetxek/adrianmoreno.info)
2. A simpler [demo site for the theme, adritian-demo](https://adritian-demo.vercel.app/) ([and its code](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo)).

## Download

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme.git`.
[Download from ](https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/archive/main.zip)GitHub.

## Installation

#### Install Hugo

To use `adritian-free-hugo-theme` you need to install Hugo by following https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/.

#### Setting up
As a pre-requirement, you will need Hugo set up and running. You can follow [the official guide for it](https://gohugo.io/categories/installation/).

The theme has been tested with the version `0.136` of Hugo. If you get errors regarding missing functionalities, check if you have the last version of Hugo available.

Note: the theme has **not** been migrated to Hugo Modules yet. To install it, you need to set it up by copying the theme files (either as a sub-module or by copying the files). You can follow these [older instructions](https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) or the next ones as help:

- Create a new Hugo site (this will create a new folder): `hugo new site <your website's name>`
- Enter the newly created folder: `cd <your website's name>/`
- Install PostCSS: execute `npm i -D postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer` from the top-level site folder [check [Hugo's official docs](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/)].
- Clone the adritian-free-hugo-theme: `git clone https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme.git themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme`.
- Replace the `hugo.toml` file in the project's root directory with themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/config.toml: `cp themes/adritian-free-hugo-theme/exampleSite/hugo.toml hugo.toml` (*executed from the website root folder*)
- Start Hugo with `hugo server -D`
- ðŸŽ‰ The theme is alive on http://localhost:1313/

The output for the last command will be something like
```

## Dark theme

The theme has a dark mode, that is enabled automatically based on system settings:

#### Additional configuration

##### Contact form
_(optional, if you want to use the contact form)_ edit line 212 in your `homepage.yml` file, to customize your mail address. Sign up in [formspree](https://formspree.io) to redirect mails to your own.

##### Blog

<img width="1271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1821a3b7-f572-4958-8c4f-bd1687cc8f71">


To use the blog, you can use the content type "blog", and render it in the URL `/blog`.
You can add a menu link to it in `hugo.toml`.

The posts will be markdown files stored in the `content/blog` folder.

##### Experience

This functionality and content is especially suited for personal professional sites, showcasing the work experience: 

<img width="1444" alt="SCR-20240624-uaoi" src="https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme/assets/240085/9ea86d6a-62c6-4c4f-96ba-8450fa24dd68">

It can be used to render job experience, projects or clients. Each experience/project has a duration, job title, company name, location and description/excerpt as well as a longer text. 

The experience is managed through a specific content type (see `content/experience` for an example).
You can use `hugo new experience/experience-name.md` (replacing `experience-name` by the name of the job experience).
This will create the content in the `content/experience` folder, following the `experience` archetype.

The following fields are used from the file's Front Matter: `title`, `jobTitle`, `company`, `location`, `duration`. 
You can find a sample experience file content here:

```
---
date: 2007-12-01T00:00:00+01:00
draft: false
title: "Job #1"
jobTitle: "Junior Intern"
company: "Internet Affairs Inc. "
location: "Stavanger, Norway"
duration: "2022-2024"

---
### Fixing the world, one byte at a time

The beginning of a great career. 
```

The experience is displayed in several locations:

1. Homepage, with a limited number of experiences (controlled by the config parameter `homepageExperienceCount` in the file `hugo.toml`). The summary is displayed. 
2. Experience page, in `/experience`, with a list of all experiences (no limit). The summary is displayed for each item.
3. Individual experience page, where all details are displayed
